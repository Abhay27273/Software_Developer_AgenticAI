# UI Updates Applied

## Changes Made to templates/index.html

Due to the large file size (4000+ lines), I'm applying targeted updates to key sections.

### 1. Added Icon Configuration (After line 1915)
### 2. Added Akino Branding CSS
### 3. Updated Agent Message Functions
### 4. Added Progress Bar Implementation
### 5. Added File Tree Filtering

## To Apply These Changes:

Run this command to see the backup:
```bash
ls templates/index.html*
```

The updates are being applied now...
