## 📝 Project Title and Description

This project provides a robust, scalable, and high-performance **FastAPI-based AI Model Inference API**. It is designed to serve predictions from pre-trained machine learning models, offering a clean RESTful interface for seamless integration into various applications. The API leverages FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities and Pydantic for data validation, ensuring efficient and reliable model serving.

Whether you need to integrate a natural language processing model, a computer vision model, or any other AI artifact, this API provides a solid foundation for deploying your AI services at scale.

## ✨ Features

*   **RESTful API**: Clean and intuitive HTTP endpoints for model inference.
*   **Asynchronous Processing**: Built with `async/await` for high concurrency and non-blocking I/O operations.
*   **Input Validation**: Robust data validation and serialization using Pydantic models.
*   **Automatic Interactive Docs**: Self-documenting API with Swagger UI (`/docs`) and ReDoc (`/redoc`).
*   **Scalability**: Designed for easy horizontal scaling with Uvicorn and Gunicorn.
*   **Containerization Support**: Dockerfile included for easy deployment in containerized environments.
*   **Comprehensive Testing**: Includes a suite of unit and integration tests to ensure reliability.
*   **Environment Configuration**: Flexible configuration via environment variables.
*   **Health Checks**: Dedicated endpoint for monitoring API health.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python 3.9+**: The project is developed and tested with Python 3.9 and newer versions.
*   **pip**: Python package installer (usually comes with Python).
*   **git**: Version control system.
*   **Docker** (Optional, for containerized deployment): Docker Engine.

## 🚀 Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```
    *(Replace `your-username/your-repo` with the actual repository URL)*

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install project dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **(Optional) Download/Place your AI Model:**
    If your AI model files (e.g., `.pkl`, `.h5`, `.pt`, ONNX) are not part of the repository, ensure they are placed in the expected directory (e.g., `models/`).
    *Example:*
    ```bash
    # Assuming your model is named 'my_model.pkl'
    mkdir -p models
    # Place your model file here, e.g.,
    # cp /path/to/your/model/my_model.pkl models/
    ```

5.  **Run the application locally:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
    ```
    The `--reload` flag is useful for development as it restarts the server on code changes. For production, omit this flag.

    The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
    You can view the interactive API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## ⚙️ Configuration (Environment Variables)

The application uses environment variables for configuration. You can set these directly in your shell or use a `.env` file in the project root. A sample `.env.example` file is provided.

To use a `.env` file, create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project:

```bash
# .env file example
# General Settings
APP_NAME="AI Model Inference API"
DEBUG=True # Set to False for production

# Model Settings
MODEL_PATH="./models/your_model.pkl" # Path to your pre-trained model file
MODEL_NAME="MyAwesomeModel"
MODEL_VERSION="1.0.0"

# API Security (Example: Basic API Key)
API_KEY="your_secret_api_key_here" # For securing specific endpoints

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL="INFO" # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL

# Uvicorn/Gunicorn settings (can be overridden by command line)
UVICORN_HOST="0.0.0.0"
UVICORN_PORT=8000
```

**Important:** Never commit your actual `.env` file with sensitive information to version control. Use `.env.example` as a template.

## 💡 Usage Examples

Once the API is running, you can interact with it using various tools.

### 1. Accessing Interactive Documentation

Open your web browser and navigate to:
*   **Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
*   **ReDoc**: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

These interfaces allow you to explore available endpoints, view expected request/response schemas, and even make test requests directly from your browser.

### 2. Health Check

Check the API's health status:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```
Expected response:
```json
{"status": "ok"}
```

### 3. Model Prediction Example

Let's assume there's a `/predict` endpoint that accepts a JSON payload for inference.

**Using `curl`:**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "feature1": 1.2,
           "feature2": "example_text",
           "feature3": [10, 20, 30]
         }'
```

**Using Python `requests`:**

```python
import requests
import json

api_url = "http://localhost:8000/predict"
payload = {
    "feature1": 1.2,
    "feature2": "example_text",
    "feature3": [10, 20, 30]
}

headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

try:
    response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
    response.raise_for_status() # Raise an exception for HTTP errors
    print("Prediction Result:", response.json())
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

*(Note: The exact payload and endpoint will depend on your specific AI model and API implementation. Refer to `/docs` for precise details.)*

## 🚢 Deployment Instructions

This FastAPI application is designed for easy deployment.

### 1. Docker

The easiest way to deploy is using Docker. A `Dockerfile` is provided.

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t ai-inference-api .
    ```
2.  **Run the Docker container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -d --name ai-inference-service -p 8000:8000 ai-inference-api
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 2. Production Server (Gunicorn + Uvicorn)

For production environments, it's recommended to use Gunicorn as a process manager with Uvicorn workers.

1.  **Install Gunicorn:**
    ```bash
    pip install gunicorn
    ```
2.  **Run with Gunicorn:**
    ```bash
    gunicorn main:app -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
    ```
    *   `-w 4`: Specifies 4 worker processes. Adjust based on your server's CPU cores.
    *   `-k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker`: Specifies Uvicorn workers for ASGI applications.

### 3. Cloud Platforms

This application can be deployed to various cloud platforms:

*   **AWS ECS/EKS**: Use the Docker image.
*   **Google Cloud Run/GKE**: Use the Docker image.
*   **Azure Container Instances/AKS**: Use the Docker image.
