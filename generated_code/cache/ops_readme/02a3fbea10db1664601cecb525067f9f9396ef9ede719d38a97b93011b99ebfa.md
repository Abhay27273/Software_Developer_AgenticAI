## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
    *   [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
*   **pip**: Python's package installer (usually comes with Python).
*   **git**: For cloning the repository.
    *   [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## 📦 Installation

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/pixel-pioneers.git
    cd pixel-pioneers
    ```
    *(Replace `https://github.com/your-username/pixel-pioneers.git` with the actual repository URL)*

2.  **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment**:
    *   **On Windows**:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **On macOS/Linux**:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install project dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The game can be configured through various settings, some of which can be overridden using environment variables for quick adjustments without modifying the source code.

**Example Environment Variables (if applicable):**

*   `DEBUG_MODE`: Set to `True` to enable debug overlays and logging.
    ```bash
    export DEBUG_MODE=True # macOS/Linux
    set DEBUG_MODE=True   # Windows
    ```
*   `SCREEN_WIDTH`, `SCREEN_HEIGHT`: Override default screen dimensions.
    ```bash
    export SCREEN_WIDTH=1280 SCREEN_HEIGHT=720
    ```
*   `SOUND_VOLUME`: Adjust the master volume (0.0 to 1.0).
    ```bash
    export SOUND_VOLUME=0.5
    ```

*Note: Specific environment variables and their effects will depend on the game's implementation. Refer to the `config.py` or similar files in the source code for a complete list of configurable options.*

## ▶️ Usage

### Running the Game

To start playing Pixel Pioneers, ensure your virtual environment is activated and run the main game script:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Running Tests

This project includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure code quality and functionality. To run the tests:

```bash
pytest
```
*(You might need to install `pytest` if it's not in `requirements.txt`: `pip install pytest`)*

## 🚀 Deployment

For distributing Pixel Pioneers as a standalone application, `PyInstaller` is the recommended tool to package the game into an executable.

1.  **Install PyInstaller**:
    ```bash
    pip install pyinstaller
    ```

2.  **Generate the executable**:
    Navigate to the root of your project directory and run:
    ```bash
    pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed --add-data "assets;assets" main.py
    ```
    *   `--noconfirm`: Overwrite existing files without prompting.
    *   `--onefile`: Create a single executable file.
    *   `--windowed`: Create a windowed application (no console window).
    *   `--add-data "assets;assets"`: Include the `assets` folder (images, sounds, fonts) in the executable. Adjust this path if your assets are in a different directory or if you have multiple asset folders.
    *   `main.py`: The main script to run your game.

3.  **Find the executable**:
    The generated executable will be located in the `dist/` directory.
