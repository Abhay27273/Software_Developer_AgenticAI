## 3. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

*   **Python 3.8+**: The project is developed with modern Python features.
    *   You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **`pip`**: Python's package installer, usually comes with Python.
*   **`git`**: For cloning the repository.
    *   You can download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## 4. Installation

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-fastapi-project.git
    cd your-fastapi-project
    ```
    *(Replace `your-username` and `your-fastapi-project` with the actual repository details.)*

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    Install all required Python packages using `pip`.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

---

## 5. Configuration

This project uses environment variables for configuration. This allows you to easily manage settings for different environments (development, testing, production) without changing the codebase.

1.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    In the root directory of the project, create a file named `.env`.

2.  **Populate `.env` with necessary variables:**
    Below are common environment variables you might need. **Please refer to the project's actual code or documentation for the exact variables required.**

    ```dotenv
    # General Application Settings
    APP_NAME="My FastAPI Project"
    API_VERSION="v1"
    DEBUG=True # Set to False in production

    # Database Configuration (Example for PostgreSQL)
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@host:port/dbname"
    # Or for SQLite (development only):
    # DATABASE_URL="sqlite+aiosqlite:///./sql_app.db"

    # Security Settings
    SECRET_KEY="YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_KEY_HERE" # IMPORTANT: Generate a strong, unique key for production!
    ALGORITHM="HS256"
    ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30

    # CORS Settings (if applicable)
    CORS_ORIGINS=["http://localhost:3000", "http://127.0.0.1:3000"] # Comma-separated list of allowed origins

    # Other Service Integrations (e.g., external APIs, email service)
    # EXTERNAL_API_KEY="your_external_api_key"
    # EMAIL_HOST="smtp.example.com"
    # EMAIL_PORT=587
    # EMAIL_USER="user@example.com"
    # EMAIL_PASSWORD="email_password"
    ```

    **Important:**
    *   Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It should be listed in your `.gitignore`.
    *   For production, use a robust method for managing environment variables provided by your hosting platform (e.g., Kubernetes secrets, AWS Secrets Manager, Heroku Config Vars).
    *   Generate a strong, random `SECRET_KEY` for production environments.

## 6. Usage

### Running the Development Server

To start the FastAPI development server, use `uvicorn`:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

*   `app.main:app`: Specifies the FastAPI application instance. (Adjust `app.main` if your main application file is different).
*   `--reload`: Enables auto-reloading on code changes (for development).
*   `--host 0.0.0.0`: Makes the server accessible from your network (useful for Docker or external access).
*   `--port 8000`: Sets the port the server will listen on.

Once the server is running, you can access:

*   **API Documentation (Swagger UI)**: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
*   **Alternative API Documentation (ReDoc)**: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

### Running Tests

Since the project includes tests, you can run them using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest
```

Or, if you want to see more detailed output:

```bash
pytest -v --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
```
*(Adjust `--cov=app` if your main application directory is named differently.)*

### Example API Call

You can interact with the API using `curl` or any API client (like Postman, Insomnia, or your browser).

**Example: Health Check Endpoint**

Assuming there's a basic health check endpoint at `/api/v1/health`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
```

Expected output (or similar):

```json
{"status": "ok", "message": "API is running"}
```

**Example: Creating an Item (if applicable)**

Assuming an endpoint `/api/v1/items` for creating items:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/items \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "My New Item",
    "description": "This is a description for my new item.",
    "price": 19.99,
    "tax": 1.5
  }'
```
*(Please refer to the actual API endpoints and request/response models defined in the project for specific usage.)*

---

## 7. Deployment

For production deployment, it's crucial to use a robust WSGI server like Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers.

### 1. Using Gunicorn with Uvicorn Workers

```bash
gunicorn app.main:app --workers 4 --worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
```

*   `app.main:app`: Your FastAPI application instance.
*   `--workers 4`: Number of worker processes. A common recommendation is `(2 * CPU_CORES) + 1`.
*   `--worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker`: Specifies Uvicorn workers for ASGI applications.
*   `--bind 0.0.0.0:8000`: Binds the server to all network interfaces on port 8000.

### 2. Dockerization (Recommended)

A `Dockerfile` is often included or can be easily created for FastAPI projects. This allows for consistent deployment across different environments.

**Example `Dockerfile` (if not already present):**

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 8000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 8000

# Run the application using Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers
CMD ["gunicorn", "app.main:app", "--workers", "4", "--worker-class", "uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
```

**Build and Run Docker Image:**

```bash
docker build -t your-fastapi-app .
docker run -p 8000:8000 your-fastapi-app
```

### 3. Cloud Platforms

This project can be deployed to various cloud platforms such as:

*   **Heroku**: Use a `Procfile` and environment variables.
*   **AWS (ECS, EKS, EC2, Lambda with API Gateway)**: Leverage Docker images and AWS services.
*   **Google Cloud (Cloud Run, GKE, Compute Engine)**: Similar to AWS, using Docker.
*   **Azure (App Service, AKS)**: Also supports Docker-based deployments.

**Important Considerations for Production:**

*   **Environment Variables**: Ensure all sensitive information (e.g., `SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`) is securely passed as environment variables, not hardcoded.
*   **HTTPS**: Always deploy behind a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Caddy) that handles SSL/TLS termination.
*   **Logging**: Configure proper logging for monitoring and debugging.
*   **Monitoring**: Set up application performance monitoring (APM) and error tracking.
*   **Database Migrations**: Automate database schema migrations as part of your deployment pipeline.
*   **`DEBUG=False`**: Always set `DEBUG=False` in production for security and performance.
