## 1. Project Title and Description

**AI-Powered FastAPI Service Template**

This project provides a robust, scalable, and well-structured template for building AI-powered API services using FastAPI. Leveraging the high performance and developer-friendly features of FastAPI, this template is designed to accelerate the development and deployment of machine learning models, natural language processing tasks, computer vision applications, or any AI-driven logic as a RESTful API.

Generated with best practices in mind, this boilerplate includes essential components for a production-ready service, such as dependency management, environment configuration, comprehensive testing, and clear deployment pathways. It serves as an excellent starting point for developers looking to integrate AI capabilities into their applications with a modern Python backend.

## 2. Features

*   **FastAPI Framework:** High-performance, easy-to-use web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+.
*   **Asynchronous Support:** Built-in support for `async`/`await` operations, enabling highly concurrent and non-blocking I/O.
*   **Automatic Interactive API Documentation:** Swagger UI (`/docs`) and ReDoc (`/redoc`) are automatically generated from your code.
*   **Pydantic Models:** Data validation and serialization using Pydantic, ensuring robust request and response handling.
*   **Structured Project Layout:** A clear and organized directory structure for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Environment Configuration:** Secure management of sensitive information and settings using `.env` files and `python-dotenv`.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** Includes `pytest` for unit and integration testing, ensuring code reliability.
*   **Dependency Management:** `pip` and `requirements.txt` for managing project dependencies.
*   **Error Handling:** Centralized exception handling for consistent API responses.
*   **Logging:** Basic logging setup for monitoring and debugging.
*   **Placeholder for AI Model Integration:** Designed to easily integrate various AI models (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn) within dedicated service layers.

## 3. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

*   **Python 3.8+:** Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **pip:** Python's package installer (usually comes with Python).
*   **venv:** Python's built-in module for creating virtual environments.
*   **git:** For cloning the repository (optional, but recommended).

## 4. Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to get your development environment up and running:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-fastapi-service.git
    cd ai-fastapi-service
    ```
    *(Replace `https://github.com/your-username/ai-fastapi-service.git` with the actual repository URL.)*

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    *   **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **On Windows (Command Prompt):**
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```
    *   **On Windows (PowerShell):**
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all required packages using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 5. Configuration (Environment Variables)

This project uses environment variables for configuration, loaded from a `.env` file in the project root. This approach keeps sensitive information out of version control and allows for easy configuration changes across different environments (development, staging, production).

1.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project.

2.  **Add Configuration Variables:**
    Populate the `.env` file with your specific settings. Here are some common examples:

    ```env
    # Application Settings
    APP_NAME="AI FastAPI Service"
    DEBUG=True # Set to False for production

    # API Keys (Example)
    # OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-openai-key"
    # EXTERNAL_SERVICE_API_KEY="your-external-service-key"

    # AI Model Configuration (Example)
    MODEL_PATH="./models/my_ai_model.pkl"
    MODEL_VERSION="1.0.0"
    # GPU_ENABLED=False # Set to True if using GPU for inference
    ```

    *Note: Do not commit your `.env` file to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore`.*

## 6. Usage Examples

### Running the Development Server

To start the FastAPI application in development mode with auto-reloading:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Once the server is running, you can access:
*   **Interactive API Documentation (Swagger UI):** `http://localhost:8000/docs`
*   **Alternative API Documentation (ReDoc):** `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

### Example API Endpoints

This template includes placeholder endpoints. You would typically replace or extend these with your AI model's specific inference logic.

**1. Health Check**
*   **Endpoint:** `/health`
*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **Description:** Checks if the API is running.
*   **Example Request:**
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8000/health
    ```
*   **Example Response:**
    ```json
    {"status": "ok"}
    ```

**2. Predict Endpoint (Example)**
*   **Endpoint:** `/predict`
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Description:** An example endpoint for sending data to an AI model and getting a prediction.
*   **Example Request (using `curl`):**
    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{"text": "This is a test sentence for sentiment analysis."}' \
         http://localhost:8000/predict
    ```
*   **Example Response (placeholder):**
    ```json
    {"input_text": "This is a test sentence for sentiment analysis.", "prediction": "positive", "confidence": 0.92}
    ```
    *(The actual response will depend on your integrated AI model.)*

### Running Tests

To execute the test suite:

```bash
pytest
```

To run tests with coverage reporting:

```bash
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
```

## 7. Deployment Instructions

Deploying a FastAPI application typically involves containerization (Docker) and a production-grade ASGI server (like Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers).

### 1. Dockerization (Recommended)

1.  **Build the Docker Image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t ai-fastapi-service:latest .
    ```

2.  **Run the Docker Container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -d --name ai-service -p 80:8000 ai-fastapi-service:latest
    ```
    This will run the service on port 80 of your host, forwarding to port 8000 inside the container.

### 2. Production Server (without Docker)

For production environments, it's recommended to use a robust ASGI server like Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers.

1.  **Install Gunicorn:**
    ```bash
    pip install gunicorn
    ```

2.  **Run with Gunicorn and Uvicorn Workers:**
    ```bash
    gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker app.main:app --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
    ```
    *   `-w 4`: Specifies 4 worker processes (adjust based on your server's CPU cores).
    *   `-k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker`: Uses Uvicorn workers for asynchronous handling.
    *   `app.main:app`: Points to your FastAPI application instance.

### 3. Cloud Deployment

This template is well-suited for deployment on various cloud platforms:

*   **AWS:** ECS, EKS, Lambda (with API Gateway), Elastic Beanstalk, App Runner.
*   **Google Cloud:** Cloud Run, GKE, App Engine.
*   **Azure:** Azure App Service, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Container Instances.
*   **Heroku:** Using a `Procfile`.

Ensure that you configure environment variables appropriately for your chosen cloud provider.
