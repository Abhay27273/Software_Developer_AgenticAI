## 🛠️ Installation

Follow these steps to get AstroBlast: Galactic Gauntlet up and running on your local machine.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/astroblast-galactic-gauntlet.git
    cd astroblast-galactic-gauntlet
    ```
    *(Replace `your-username` with the actual GitHub username/organization.)*

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    *   **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Run Tests (Optional but Recommended):**
    To ensure everything is set up correctly and the game's core logic is sound, you can run the provided test suite:
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
    *(If `pytest` is not found, install it via `pip install pytest`)*

## ⚙️ Configuration (Environment Variables)

The game can be configured using environment variables for certain settings. This allows for flexible adjustments without modifying the source code.

*   `ASTROBLAST_DEBUG_MODE`: Set to `True` or `1` to enable debug overlays (e.g., hitboxes, FPS counter).
    *   **Example (Linux/macOS):** `export ASTROBLAST_DEBUG_MODE=True`
    *   **Example (Windows CMD):** `set ASTROBLAST_DEBUG_MODE=True`
    *   **Example (Windows PowerShell):** `$env:ASTROBLAST_DEBUG_MODE="True"`
*   `ASTROBLAST_SCREEN_WIDTH`: Override the default screen width (e.g., `1280`).
*   `ASTROBLAST_SCREEN_HEIGHT`: Override the default screen height (e.g., `720`).
*   `ASTROBLAST_STARTING_LIVES`: Set the initial number of player lives (e.g., `5`).

These variables should be set in your shell *before* launching the game.

## ▶️ Usage

Once installed, you can launch the game from the project root directory.

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment is active.** (See Installation Step 3)

2.  **Run the game:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

### Game Controls:

*   **Arrow Keys / WASD**: Move your spaceship.
*   **Spacebar**: Fire projectiles.
*   **P**: Pause/Unpause the game.
*   **Esc**: Exit the game (from main menu or pause menu).

## 📦 Deployment

To distribute AstroBlast: Galactic Gauntlet as a standalone executable, you can use tools like `PyInstaller`. This packages your Python application and all its dependencies into a single executable file.

1.  **Install PyInstaller:**
    ```bash
    pip install pyinstaller
    ```

2.  **Generate Executable:**
    Navigate to the project's root directory and run:
    ```bash
    pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed --add-data "assets;assets" main.py
    ```
    *   `--noconfirm`: Overwrite existing files without asking.
    *   `--onefile`: Create a single executable file.
    *   `--windowed`: Prevent a console window from appearing (for GUI applications).
    *   `--add-data "assets;assets"`: Include the `assets` folder (images, sounds, fonts) in the executable. *(Adjust this path if your assets are organized differently, e.g., `src/assets;assets`)*

3.  **Find the Executable:**
    The executable will be located in the `dist/` directory within your project folder.
