# Project Scope & MVP Definition: Mobile Racing Game

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2023-10-27
**Status:** DRAFT - Awaiting Sign-off

---

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1. Project Vision
To create an engaging and intuitive mobile racing game that leverages gyroscope controls for a realistic and immersive driving experience. The initial release will be a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focused on delivering a polished core gameplay loop.

### 1.2. Project Goals
-   **Validate Core Mechanic:** Confirm that gyroscope-based steering is fun, responsive, and accessible to a casual audience.
-   **Establish Technical Foundation:** Build a scalable architecture for the game client and any supporting services.
-   **Gather User Feedback:** Release a functional, albeit limited, version of the game to collect early user data and feedback to inform future development.
-   **Minimize Time-to-Market:** Launch the MVP quickly to test market viability.

## 2. Target Audience & Platforms

### 2.1. Target Audience
-   Casual to mid-core mobile gamers.
-   Players who enjoy racing games but may be new to motion controls.
-   Users with modern smartphones equipped with a gyroscope.

### 2.2. Target Platforms
-   **iOS:** iOS 15 and newer.
-   **Android:** Android 10 (API level 29) and newer.

## 3. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope

The MVP is tightly focused on delivering a complete, single-player race experience from start to finish.

### 3.1. In-Scope MVP Features

#### 3.1.1. Core Gameplay Mechanics
-   **Vehicle Control:**
    -   **Steering:** Gyroscope-based steering is the primary control method. The player tilts their device left and right to steer the car.
    -   **Acceleration:** Auto-acceleration will be enabled by default.
    -   **Braking:** A single, on-screen touch button for braking/reversing.
-   **Physics:** Basic vehicle physics model for handling, traction, and collisions with track boundaries.
-   **Game Loop:**
    1.  Player starts the game and sees the main menu.
    2.  Player selects "Race" to begin.
    3.  A brief countdown (3-2-1-GO!) initiates the race.
    4.  Player completes a set number of laps (e.g., 3 laps).
    5.  Upon completion, a results screen displays the final race time.
    6.  Player can choose to race again or return to the main menu.

#### 3.1.2. Content
-   **Vehicles:** **One (1)** pre-selected, non-customizable sports car.
-   **Tracks:** **One (1)** unique, well-designed race track. The track will be a closed circuit.

#### 3.1.3. User Interface (UI)
-   **Main Menu Screen:**
    -   Game Title
    -   "Start Race" button
    -   "Quit" button
-   **In-Game HUD (Heads-Up Display):**
    -   Current Lap / Total Laps (e.g., "1/3")
    -   Current Race Time
    -   Brake Button
-   **Race Results Screen:**
    -   "Race Finished!" message
    -   Final Race Time
    -   "Race Again" button
    -   "Main Menu" button

### 3.2. Out-of-Scope for MVP

To ensure a focused and timely delivery, the following features are explicitly **excluded** from the MVP scope. They will be considered for future releases based on user feedback and project success.

-   **Multiplayer:** No online or local multiplayer functionality.
-   **AI Opponents:** The player will race against the clock, not AI-controlled cars.
-   **Vehicle Selection/Customization:** No garage, car purchasing, or visual/performance upgrades.
-   **Track Selection:** Only one track will be available.
-   **Player Progression:** No career mode, experience points, currency, or leaderboards.
-   **Advanced Controls:** No manual acceleration, drifting mechanics, or alternative control schemes (e.g., on-screen wheel).
-   **Sound Design:** Minimal placeholder sound effects for engine and collisions. No background music.
-   **Settings Menu:** No options for graphics, audio, or control sensitivity adjustments.
-   **Monetization:** No in-app purchases or advertisements.

## 4. Technical & Design Constraints

### 4.1. Technical Constraints
-   **Engine:** The project will be developed using a specific game engine (e.g., Unity, Unreal Engine - TBD in technical design phase). All development must adhere to the chosen engine's best practices.
-   **Performance:** The game must maintain a stable framerate (target: 30 FPS minimum) on a defined range of mid-tier devices.
-   **Hardware Dependency:** The core gameplay relies on the presence and accuracy of a device's gyroscope and accelerometer. The app must handle cases where this hardware is missing or malfunctioning.
-   **Build Size:** The initial application download size should be kept minimal (target: under 100MB) to encourage downloads.

### 4.2. Design Constraints
-   **Art Style:** A simplified, clean, low-poly art style will be used for the car and track to expedite asset creation and ensure high performance.
-   **UI/UX:** The user interface will be minimalist and functional, prioritizing clarity over complex animations or visual flair.
-   **Scope Rigidity:** The MVP scope is fixed. No feature creep will be permitted without a formal change request and re-evaluation of the project timeline and resources.
