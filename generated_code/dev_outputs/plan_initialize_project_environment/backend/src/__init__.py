# This file makes the 'src' directory a Python package.

# Define the package version as per best practices.
# This also ensures the file is not completely empty, which can sometimes
# cause unexpected behavior or timeouts in certain test environments
# that expect some executable code for package initialization.
__version__ = "0.1.0"

# Placeholder for future package-level imports or initializations.
# For example, you might import core modules or configuration here:
# from . import config
# from .game_module import Game
