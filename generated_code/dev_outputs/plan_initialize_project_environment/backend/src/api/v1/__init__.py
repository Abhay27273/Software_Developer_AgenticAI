"""
This file makes the 'v1' directory a Python package.
It can be used to define package-level imports, variables, or configurations.
"""

# Define __all__ to explicitly list public API for 'from v1 import *'.
# For a package that doesn't expose specific top-level items, an empty list is appropriate.
__all__ = []

# No specific initialization logic is required for a basic package.
# Additional imports or setup can be added here if needed for the package.
# For example:
# from . import some_module
# from .subpackage import another_module

# You might also define package-level metadata here:
# __version__ = "0.1.0"
# __author__ = "Your Name"
