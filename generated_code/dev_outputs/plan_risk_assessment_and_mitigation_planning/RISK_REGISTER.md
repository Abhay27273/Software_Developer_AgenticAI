| **R01** | Technical             | **Inconsistent Gyroscope Performance:** `DeviceMotionEvent` API behaves differently across devices, browsers, and OS versions, causing jitter, lag, or unresponsiveness. | High       | High   | Critical | 1. Early-stage testing on a diverse device matrix. 2. Implement data smoothing algorithms (e.g., Low-pass filter). 3. Provide user-configurable sensitivity/calibration settings. | 1. Implement a fallback touch-based control scheme. 2. Display a "Device Not Supported" message for devices that fail a baseline performance check. | Tech Lead  |
| **R02** | Technical             | **Real-time Performance Bottlenecks:** High-frequency WebSocket updates for game state synchronization cause server overload, high latency, and poor user experience. | Medium     | High   | High     | 1. Use efficient data serialization (e.g., MessagePack). 2. Send state deltas, not full state. 3. Implement client-side prediction. 4. Conduct rigorous load testing. | 1. Scale backend services horizontally (add more server instances). 2. Optimize critical code paths identified during performance profiling.             | Backend Lead |
| **R03** | Project Management    | **Scope Creep:** Uncontrolled addition of new features during development leads to missed deadlines and budget overruns.                                              | High       | Medium | High     | 1. Establish a formal change control process. 2. Maintain a clearly defined and agreed-upon MVP scope. 3. Prioritize backlog items using MoSCoW method.             | 1. Re-negotiate timeline and budget with stakeholders for approved scope changes. 2. Move lower-priority features to a "Phase 2" release.         | Project Manager |
| **R04** | Security              | **Insecure WebSocket Communication:** Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks or data injection through the WebSocket channel.                                                  | Medium     | High   | High     | 1. Enforce WSS (WebSocket Secure) protocol. 2. Validate and sanitize all data received from clients. 3. Implement rate limiting on incoming messages.               | 1. Immediately patch the vulnerability. 2. Force-disconnect all active sessions. 3. Conduct a security audit and post-mortem.                     | Security Lead |
| **R05** | Technical             | **Cross-Browser/Device Compatibility:** UI elements render incorrectly, or core functionality breaks on non-target browsers or devices with varying screen sizes.        | High       | Medium | High     | 1. Use modern CSS (Flexbox/Grid) and responsive design principles. 2. Regularly test on target browsers using services like BrowserStack. 3. Use feature detection. | 1. Allocate developer time to fix high-priority compatibility bugs. 2. Gracefully degrade features on unsupported browsers.                       | Frontend Lead |
| **R06** | Data                  | **Database Failure / Data Loss:** Hardware failure, software bugs, or human error leads to the loss of user profiles, scores, and leaderboard data.                     | Low        | High   | Medium   | 1. Implement automated, regular database backups (e.g., daily). 2. Use PostgreSQL's Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR). 3. Host the database in a high-availability setup. | 1. Execute the disaster recovery plan to restore the database from the latest backup. 2. Communicate downtime and potential data loss to users. | DevOps Lead |
| **R07** | Project Management    | **Key Personnel Dependency:** Critical project knowledge is concentrated in a single developer, whose unexpected absence would stall progress.                           | Low        | High   | Medium   | 1. Enforce pair programming for critical features. 2. Maintain comprehensive documentation. 3. Conduct regular knowledge-sharing sessions and code reviews.         | 1. Re-assign responsibilities to other team members. 2. Hire a contractor or new employee to fill the knowledge gap.                               | Project Manager |
| **R08** | External              | **Third-Party Service Unavailability:** An external dependency (e.g., authentication provider, CDN) experiences an outage, impacting game accessibility or functionality. | Medium     | Medium | Medium   | 1. Select reputable third-party providers with strong SLAs. 2. Implement circuit breaker patterns. 3. Cache assets locally and at the CDN edge.                  | 1. Switch to a secondary provider if one is configured. 2. Display a user-friendly error message indicating a temporary service issue.             | Tech Lead  |
